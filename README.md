Sales & Customer Analytics with Machine Learning

🔍 Project Overview

This project performs end-to-end sales and customer analytics on a dataset containing 10,000+ transactions.
It combines exploratory data analysis (EDA) with machine learning to uncover business insights and build a sales prediction model.

The project is designed from the perspective of a Data Analyst working for a firm, focusing on insights that support business decision-making.

📊 Key Business Insights
1️⃣ Revenue & Sales Performance

Clear monthly seasonality observed in sales.

Peak months indicate high-demand periods.

Average order value reflects pricing effectiveness.

📌 Business Impact:
Better inventory and marketing planning.

2️⃣ Product & Category Insights

Electronics and Fashion generate the highest revenue.

Grocery shows high volume but lower margins.

A small number of products contribute most revenue (Pareto principle).

📌 Business Impact:
Focus on high-margin products and optimize low-performing SKUs.

3️⃣ Customer Behavior

Around 20% of customers generate ~60% of revenue.

Repeat customers spend significantly more than one-time buyers.

📌 Business Impact:
Implement loyalty programs and retention strategies.

4️⃣ Regional Insights

Certain regions dominate overall sales.

Category performance varies by region.

📌 Business Impact:
Region-specific inventory and pricing strategies.

5️⃣ Time-Based Patterns

Higher sales during weekends.

Consistent but lower sales during weekdays.

📌 Business Impact:
Run promotions during high-traffic days.
